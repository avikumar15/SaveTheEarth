# SaveTheEarth

IRON MAN

Iron Man is one of the most powerful superheroes in MARVEL. He’s ultra-committed to protecting the Earth from destructive powers of the universe. He’s done it before and he’ll do it again. With his brainchild AI assistant Jarvis, he can truly build himself an armor or an army of armors in no time. Thanos faced his wrath, and so will any other negative force that has their eyes set on Planet Earth.

Besides being very powerful, Iron Man is a great team person, who can lead and assemble the Avengers whenever need be. What makes him unstoppable is his genius self who can own any new game plan in no time. He’s a great mentor, like he’s been for Spiderman. His sense of humor may not save the planet, but certainly lifts the mood of every other superhero out there. Clearly, this is a man with a plan. He understands safety of the people on Earth is of paramount importance, and treats it likewise. This is not your average superhero who will destroy half a city trying to kill an alien. Compassion, empathy, intelligence, and knack for saving the planet from the worst of villains make Iron Man the superhero sensation that he is!
