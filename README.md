# SaveTheEarth

IRON MAN

Iron Man is one of the most powerful superheroes in MARVEL. He’s ultra-committed to protecting the Earth from destructive powers of the universe. He’s done it before and he’ll do it again. With his brainchild AI assistant Jarvis, he can truly build himself an armor or an army of armors in no time. This makes him a force to reckon with, for most villain dudes. Thanos faced his wrath, and so will any other negative force that has their eyes set on Planet Earth.
